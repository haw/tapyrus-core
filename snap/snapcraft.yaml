summary:  federation governed blockchain
description: |
        Tapyrus is a blockchain that has been forked from Bitcoin Core, and solves
        the governance issues. Bitcoin uses Proof of Work as a consensus algorithm,
        but Tapyrus creates a block (ie, approves a transaction) with multiple
        signatures from the Signer group which consists of industry stakeholders.
        Therefore, transactions on the blockchain are stably approved, and finality
        is given at the time of approval. Anyone can join the Tapyrus network, and
        anyone can access the public ledger and create and broadcast transactions freely.

  # Make sure /var/tmp is writable by mounting as tmpfs.
  #
  # Berkeley DB sometimes creates temporary backing files under /var/tmp.
  # BDB should respect TMPDIR environment variable to determine where to create
  # such temporary files, however curiously, it sometimes ignores the
  # environment variable. Unwritable temporary directory will prevent wallet
  # database files from reloading.
